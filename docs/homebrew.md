# Mac Homebrew
https://brew.sh/

After installing homebrew I add the bin path to my .bashrc

```bash
# Setting the PATH for Homebrew, and programs installed by Homebrew
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"

```

This will include an binaries installed by homebrew which should end up in the `/opt/homebrew/bin/` directory.
